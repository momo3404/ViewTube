This web app is a youtube clone that allows users to sign in through Google and upload and watch videos. The app leverages Google Cloud services for scalability, using Google Cloud Storage for video storage, Cloud Pub/Sub for handling video upload events, and Cloud Run for video processing. Users can sign in with their Google accounts, upload videos that are then transcoded into multiple formats, and view these videos via a Next.js web client. The app also integrates Firebase services for user authentication, API management, and storing video metadata in Firestore.
